    <h1>Celine Cerezci</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Celine Cerezci. I am a fourth year student at Northeastern University. I study Finance and Data Science. I’m currently on a five year 2 co-op path, and have completed one co-op. My first co-op was at BNY Mellon. At BNY Mellon, I was an investment analyst, and got to see trades from the corporate side. After this co-op, I added a data science major to further my analysis skills. Since then, I’ve learned multiple languages such as python, SQL, and R. Below is a list of things I hope to add to my website soon: </p>
